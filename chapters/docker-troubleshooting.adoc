== Troubleshooting

=== Network Timed Out

Depending upon the network speed and restrictions, you may not be able to download Docker images from Docker Hub. The error message may look like:

```console
$ docker pull arungupta/wildfly-mysql-javaee7
Using default tag: latest
Pulling repository docker.io/arungupta/wildfly-mysql-javaee7
Network timed out while trying to connect to https://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/arungupta/wildfly-mysql-javaee7/images. You may want to check your internet connection or if you are behind a proxy.
```

This section provide a couple of alternatives to solve this.

==== Restart Docker Machine

It seems like Docker Machine gets into a strange state and restarting it fixes that.

```console
docker-machine restart <MACHINE_NAME>
eval $(docker-machine env <MACHINE_NAME>)
```

==== Loading Images Offline

Images can be downloaded from a previously saved `.tar` file. All images required for this workshop can be downloaded from:

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8g4lYJ4uB37RkdqbFpPZU5ZS2s&usp=sharing

Load the tar file:

[source, text]
----
docker load -i <path to image tar file>
----

For example:

[source, text]
----
docker load -i arungupta-javaee7-hol.tar
----

Now `docker images` should show the image.

=== Cannot create Docker Machine on Windows

Are you not able to create Docker Machine on Windows?

Try starting a `cmd` with Administrator privileges and then give the command again.

=== No route to host

Accessing the WildFly and MySQL sample in Kubernetes gives 404 when you give the command `curl http://10.246.1.23:8080/employees/resources/employees/`.

This may be resolved by stopping the node and restarting the cluster again:

```console
vagrant halt minion-1
./cluster/kube-up.sh
```

These commands need to be given in the '`kubernetes`' directory.

=== Docker machine creation fails with an error about dial tcp: i/o timeout

If you get the following error when creating a docker machine

```console
Error creating machine: Error in driver during machine creation: Get https://api.github.com/repos/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases: dial tcp: i/o timeout
```

Then you need to go to the boot2docker releases page on

https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases

And download the latest .iso

After that you can move that iso to the docker cache directory. This is located in `~/.docker/machine/cache` on Mac & Linux and
`/Users/yourUserName/.docker/machine/cache` on Windows.

Issue: https://github.com/docker/machine/issues/2186 is raised so that the docker-machine team can hopefully find a way around this.

=== "`You may be getting rate limited by Github`" error message

Credits: https://github.com/docker/machine/blob/master/README.md#troubleshooting

In order to `create` or `upgrade` virtual machines running Docker, Docker
Machine will check the Github API for the latest release of the [boot2docker
operating system](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker).  The Github API
allows for a small number of unauthenticated requests from a given client, but
if you share an IP address with many other users (e.g. in an office), you may
get rate limited by their API, and Docker Machine will error out with messages
indicating this.

In order to work around this issue, you can https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/[generate a
token] and pass it to Docker Machine using the global `--github-api-token` flag:

```console
$ docker-machine --github-api-token=token create -d virtualbox newbox
```

This should eliminate any issues you've been experiencing with rate limiting.

=== Docker Machine Troubleshooting

https://github.com/docker/machine/blob/master/README.md#troubleshooting[Docker Machine Troubleshooting] section has good tips on what
can possibly go wrong with Docker Machine. Look there if your issue is not explained here.

=== Starting up the Kubernetes cluster fails with a connection refused

If you run into the following error after running `./cluster/kube-up.sh` (with the vagrant provider)

```console
Waiting for each minion to be registered with cloud provider
error: couldn't read version from server: Get https://10.245.1.2/api: dial tcp 10.245.1.2:443: connection refused
```

Just try the `./cluster/kube-up.sh` command a few more times until it works.
